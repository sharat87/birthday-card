# Birthday Card

This a static site holding a randomly generated SVG flower art intended as a birthday greeting for my wife in the 
year 2017.

You can see that I experimented with several drawing libraries (most of them Canvas based), but the final version is 
built based on SVG, written using [svg.js](http://svgjs.com/) library.
